This site list the tools that the ACPS directorate has developed including architectural analysis tools, CPS analysis closer to the code level, and execution environment such as real-time schedulers and the corresponding analyses and verified hypervisors.

 Architectural design and analysis techology comprises, first the Open-Source-AADL-Tool-Environment (OSATE) that can be obtain from its own independent site: [OSATE Site](https://osate.org).

# Architectural Model/Analysis tools

## Oqarina

Oqarina is a mechanization of AADL using Coq. It provides a set of capabilities to represent an AADL model using Coq types and perform some processing. It is presented in [this page](tools/oqarina)

# Execution and Behavioral Analysis tools

## Real-Time Mixed-Trust Computation

The real-time mixed-trust computation framework is a real-time runtime environment and analyses tool to enable the enforcement-based verification by the creation of mixed-trust real-time tasks with unverified components guarded by verified components that execute in a verified hypervisor.
